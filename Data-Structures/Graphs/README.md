# Graph Theory

## Binary Tree as a Graph
A Binary Tree is a graph, a type of graph. What are its limitations? Each node can only have two children, as well as the tree only goes from top to bottom.

## Basic Graph Definition
A Graph 'G' is an ordered pair of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E). G = (V,E).

Can take any data structure and represent the nodes as Vertices, and the connections as Edges.

## Edge Types
Edges have two types, directed and undirected. Binary Tree has directed edges because they always point one direction. Undirected can go both directions (bi-lateral) meaning up and down, OR, they can simply point to any node they want.

## Weighted Graphs
Weighted Graphs, use weights to represent the estimated cost of moving from along one edge from one verticy to another. For example, if we want to find the cheapest flight or shortest distance from New York to Sydney, we can build a graph with edges and find out what the shortest path is.

## Summary
A graph is a series of Vertices and Edges that represent some problem or domain that we want to search or traverse.
